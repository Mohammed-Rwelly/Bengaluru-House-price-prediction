# Bengaluru-House-price-prediction
The objective of the project is to create a Machine Learning Model .We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing price
In this project, we will implement a Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc. 
During this Bangaluru House Price prediction using Machine Learning tutorial you will learn several things like:
# 1-Exploratory data analysis
# 2-Dealing with a missing values or noisy data
# 3-Data preprocessing
# 4-Create new features from existing features
# 5-Remove outliers
# 6-Data visualisation
# 7-Splitting data into the training and testing 
# 8-Train linear regression model and test.
